        Hello, my name is Sam, and I was born in Bristol, England, before relocating to Australia 
        <br>when I was 6 years old. I spent my primary and secondary school years in Brisbane, where I 
        <br>also grew up and established my life. Right up until I received my Certificate IV in Cyber 
        <br>Security, I mostly worked in the hospitality industry. Since then, I've decided to leave the 
        <br>hospitality industry and have started a job in IT as a tech support officer. I've made the 
        <br>decision to pursue a profession in software development throughout this journey. I have 
        <br>grown to love this area because it has been a constant in my life and because of the 
        <br>limitless opportunities and enjoyment it has provided me. On a side note, I'm related to 
        <br>Robert the Bruce, the former king of the Scots. This character, the deuteragonist who 
        <br>betrayed William Wallace, may be recognisable to you from the film Braveheart. But don't 
        <br>worry; I have no desire to take your land or your freedom.

    <h4 style="text-align:center">Interest in IT</h4>
    <p style="text-align:center">
        In recent years and since commencing my job, I have grown increasingly interested in programming and developed a passionate curiosity into how far I can take myself with it. I have always grown up around computers, with my father being in database management, and have always had a personal interest in Information Technology. I'm most interested by the way things work, as well as how they can be broken. 
        My first experience with IT came when I was 14. The release of a particular buffer overflow exploit (Twilight Hack) for The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess allowed one to inject unsigned code into the console though an SD card, modifying the firmware to enable further exploitation. Though this had many possibilities, I took an interest in debugging the console's RAM whilst running games and creating my own "cheat codes". This was achievable thanks to a modified GameCube Memory Card (USB Gecko) which allowed me to plug the console into my computer and view what is happening inside the memory live. This was done with the help of an application called WiiRD (Wii Remote Debugger). This also came with the ability to alter the values attached to addresses and even rewrite code on an assembly-level.  Want to make a Moon-Jump cheat? Isolate the address that has a decrementing value as your character is falling, find which one targets fall speed, lock it to a positive float value and fly away.
        I made the decision to attend RMIT because I had just left the bartending industry and begun a brand-new adventure and job as a Customer Tech Support Officer for a software firm. I had long wanted to go to university, but I wasn't sure about doing so until my manager mentioned that he had earned his own Bachelor of Information Technology from RMIT. He stated that the course was excellent and encouraged me to get started. I hope to obtain the information and skills necessary to advance in my profession while also deepening my understanding of software development and the technologies involved. Due to my personal interest in the topic of encryption and the reality that security is becoming significantly more relevant over time, I also aim to build upon my knowledge in cyber security. Developing the skills necessary to advance within the organisation where I am currently employed is my goal.
