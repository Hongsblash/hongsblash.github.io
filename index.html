        Hi, I’m Sam, I was originally born in Bristol in the United Kingdom before moving to Australia when I was 6 years old. I’ve grown up and built my life in Brisbane, where I’ve completed my primary and secondary education. I was mostly working in Hospitality until I was awarded my Certificate IV in Cyber Security. Since then, I made the decision to get out of Hospitality and began my career in IT as a Tech Support Officer. Throughout this journey I have decided that I want to pursue a career in Software Development. Being something that has been around me my entire life, mixed with the endless possibilities and enjoyment it has brought me, I have become very enamoured with this field. A side note about me is that I’m related to Robert the Bruce, the old king of the Scots. You might recognise this name from the movie Braveheart as the deuteragonist who betrayed William Wallace. Fret not though, for I’m not interest in taking your land or your freedom.
