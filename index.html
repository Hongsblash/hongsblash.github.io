        Hello, my name is Sam, and I was born in Bristol, England, before relocating to Australia 
        <br>when I was 6 years old. I spent my primary and secondary school years in Brisbane, where I 
        <br>also grew up and established my life. Right up until I received my Certificate IV in Cyber 
        <br>Security, I mostly worked in the hospitality industry. Since then, I've decided to leave the 
        <br>hospitality industry and have started a job in IT as a tech support officer. I've made the 
        <br>decision to pursue a profession in software development throughout this journey. I have 
        <br>grown to love this area because it has been a constant in my life and because of the 
        <br>limitless opportunities and enjoyment it has provided me. On a side note, I'm related to 
        <br>Robert the Bruce, the former king of the Scots. This character, the deuteragonist who 
        <br>betrayed William Wallace, may be recognisable to you from the film Braveheart. But don't 
        <br>worry; I have no desire to take your land or your freedom.
